Some cities are developed, some are developing and some are at the inital stage.The buildings,population, various restaurants, transportation,various shops,various cusines,demographics,environments and culture are different from one another.I am going to analyse the cusine around the neighborhoods of city in order to determine that how popular those restarants are.
